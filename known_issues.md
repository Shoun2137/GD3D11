# Known Issues

## General
- for some reason (probably due to UIscale fuckery), changing resolution repeatedly fucks up gothic fonts
- emitter logic is still fucked up and im too tired to investigate
- there could still be some "blackscreen" crashing due to dangling pointers on the Gothic API
- and more
